ThirdLove disrupted the lingerie industry by empowering women to find their perfect fit online with our innovative Fitting Room® quiz and is one of the original brands to operate 100% direct-to-consumer. All design and R&D is done in-house, and our extensive and complex supply chain is fully managed by our team. Inclusivity is at the core of who we are and how we serve our customers and build our teams.

Traditionally, women were given a choice between two options when it came to their bras and underwear: Be sexy, or be comfortable. Our Cofounders: Dave Spector, Heidi Zak, and Ra’el Cohen, thought that was outdated too — so, in 2013, they created ThirdLove — a third, better option, which doesn’t force us to choose between being sexy or comfortable.

What Our Team Embodies

Our culture is collaborative, fast-paced, and data-driven, and we were most recently recognized with the Great Place to Work certification. This recognition is given to a very small percentage of companies who apply for it and determined by employees’ real-time reports of their company culture. Earning this designation demonstrates to us that our team at ThirdLove is inspired by our mission, engaged in their everyday work, and enjoy partnering with our teammates and customers.

Are you looking for a fully remote position where you can contribute to the mission of combating preventable blindness and improving lives? Join us in helping patients preserve their vision and live healthier, longer lives through tailored, timely, and intelligent care. This could be the perfect opportunity for you!

About Lumata Health

Blindness is a devastating—but largely preventable—consequence of poorly managed chronic eye diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. These debilitating diseases are expected to double between 2020 and 2050, outpacing the capacity of providers and contributing to the rising cost of eye disorders in the US, which already exceeds $99B in direct medical costs annually. In over 95% of cases, disease progression can be slowed or stopped, preserving vision and extending healthspan. But doing so requires tailored, timely, and intelligent engagement throughout the patient's lifelong care journey. That's where Lumata comes in.

Lumata Health is leading the way in leveraging data-driven virtual care management to address this large and rapidly growing problem. Built with $2M in funding support from the National Eye Institute, Lumata Health's Intelligent Engagement Platform maximizes the impact of multichannel, personalized engagement by our team of JCAHPO-certified ophthalmic care coaches. Lumata takes a holistic approach to care—combining behavioral and psychosocial information with clinical data to create tailored, high-impact patient engagements. In addition to promoting adherence, we help patients overcome barriers to care by assisting with things like financial assistance programs, prescriptions and refills, insurance issues, transportation to visits, understanding their disease and care plan, and coordinating care with other providers.

With direct medical record access to hundreds of thousands of patients with vision-threatening chronic eye diseases and partnerships with over 1,400 eye care specialists in 34 states, Lumata Health is helping people affected by chronic eye conditions live healthier, longer lives.

We're looking for caring and committed teammates to join our mission of helping people see the world. If you're passionate about stopping preventable blindness, we hope you'll apply.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing?

Our products, business, and workplace culture have received numerous awards, such as being named to the Forbes Cloud 100 and a Fortune Best Workplace in Technology.

At Lucid, we hold true to our core values of teamwork over ego, innovation in everything we do, individual empowerment, initiative, and ownership, and passion and excellence in every area. We value diversity and are dedicated to creating an environment that is respectful and inclusive for everyone.

Lucid's Strategy & Analytics Rotational Program Internship provides students with an immersive summer experience during which you will learn and apply skills across all aspects of strategic problem solving - from identifying opportunities to analyzing data, presenting results, and driving change.

As part of your internship, you will split your summer across two different functions, allowing you to see multiple sides of the business and expand your knowledge and experience. The teams supported by analysts from the Strategy & Analytics team include Marketing, Demand Generation, Sales Operations, Product, Growth, Data Science, and Strategy. The tool set you develop and use will be similar across these functions, but each presents domain-specific challenges that will provide unique opportunities for learning.

Although your day-to-day work will be with the function to which you are assigned, you will be well-supported by the rest of the Strategy & Analytics team. As an intern, you will receive special coaching and guidance working alongside full-time analysts who are also embedded within your assigned function. While the team is physically distributed throughout the office, we maintain close ties by holding weekly team trainings, daily working sessions, and regular team activities. We help each other whenever possible, and with the collective efforts of the full team, there's rarely a question we can't answer.

Preferred Qualifications


 * Passion for problem-solving - If you’ve ever been so absorbed in a problem that your mind couldn’t rest until you figured it out, you’ll be in good company.
 * Willing to help and be helped - Our impact comes only through helping others make better decisions using data. We recognize that we’re stronger together - there’s no shame in asking for help, we’re not afraid to say “I don’t know”, and we actively seek feedback.
 * Desire to learn - You’ll often be answering questions that have never been answered before, which requires a high level of intellectual curiosity and an eagerness to dive into new problems, domains, tools, and techniques.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

This thriving, two-sided marketplace not only empowers developers to innovate but also enables sellers to customize and optimize their Square experience with powerful, third-party tools. Our team is dedicated to powering data-driven insights that enhance the Square App Marketplace and developer experience. By providing strategic and analytical support, the Developer Analytics Team enables data insights that drive growth and inform business decisions, helping sellers maximize the value of the Square ecosystem.

Learning Network is a growing, innovative, and customer-centric educational technology company. We seek creative and tenacious individuals to help us drive success through service.




Service is very important to us. At Learning Network, you will be among real people who care - about their customers and their colleagues.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!","Not Applicable","4099346590","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-analyst-intern-united-states-at-cisco-4099346590?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title","Raleigh, NC","4 days ago","","","2024-12-13","$44,000.00/yr - $130,000.00/yr","Computer Hardware Manufacturing, Software Development, and Computer Networking Products","Data Analyst (Intern) United States","Other"

Typeform is a refreshingly different form builder. We help over 150,000 businesses collect the data they need with forms, surveys, and quizzes that people enjoy. Designed to look striking and feel effortless to fill out, Typeform drives 500 million responses every year—and integrates with essential tools like Slack, Zapier, and Hubspot.

About the Team:

At Typeform, the Data team is making data our #1 asset. And we know how important that is— our product helps people collect information in the best way possible, by making it conversational.

About the Role:

As a Senior Data Analyst at Typeform, your mission will be to work with stakeholders to parametrize and explain business performance with meaningful and interpretable metrics. You will play a pivotal role in leveraging data to provide actionable insights that will enable the GTM department to make more informed decisions, optimize performance, and drive growth for the company.

Things you’ll do:


 * Be a strategic partner: Our data Analytics organization is a key enabler of the company’s overarching strategy and Product-Led Growth motion, not a service task for tactical questions. With that in mind, this role will work closely with cross-functional teams (i.e. Marketing, Product, and Sales) to align analytics initiatives with overall business objectives. Above and beyond performing the analysis itself, this role will help ensure we are ideating about and ultimately tackling the most impactful infrastructure and analysis challenges, and taking the right big bets together with the business.
 * Act as a critical conduit and translator for the business: define and gather data from multiple sources in collaboration with the Tracking and Data Engineering teams, subsequently ensuring that we can answer Typeform’s most pressing questions and ultimately calculate and analyze our most critical metrics in a standardized way
 * Drive impactful insights for the business: utilize SQL and/or Python to perform deep dive exploratory data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities, inherently improving our Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy and/or Product roadmap by better understanding the needs and tendencies of our customers
 * Enable self-service at scale: as repeatable questions are defined and translated into metrics, create and automate reports/dashboards (in Looker) to help non-technical partners understand and act on the health of the business
 * Help guide and drive experimentation: actively partner with the business to help design and conduct A/B testing, as well as help analyze results to optimize marketing campaigns and strategies (in Growthbook and/or Amplitude)
   
   

What you already bring to the table:


 * You have experience working in a B2B SaaS company
 * You possess an analytical mindset and you have the ability to dissect complex problems, break them down into manageable components, and apply logical reasoning to derive insights from data.
 * You are experienced in building queries with SQL and capable of analyzing data using Python or R
 * You have experience communicating with team members across all areas of the organization.
 * You have experience partnering directly with Go To Market teams and organizations (i.e. Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Support, etc.)
   
   

Extra awesome:


 * You have deep experience in marketing sciences (attribution, experimentation, personalization)
 * You are an expert on Python.
 * You have experience with dbt.
 * You have experience building dashboards in Looker and/or Tableau.
 * Experience with AWS Redshift and/or other cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery).
   
   

No one likes a guessing game — that’s why we listed the salary range for this role. Plus, we offer a 5-10% bonus on top of that, depending on your level and performance. We keep it general so to start because we use the interview process to determine the ideal level and total compensation for you based on your location, education, experience, knowledge, and skills. We also want to make sure pay is equitable across your team and that it aligns with market data, but let us worry about those details. We’re all about keeping things clear and honest, so feel free to ask us any questions along the way!

Pay range

$125,000—$184,000 USD


 * Typeform drives hundreds of millions of interactions each year, enabling conversational, human-centered experiences across the globe.

ABOUT US:

Over one hundred years ago, the Jewish community founded HIAS (originally the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) in New York City, the immigrant gateway to America. Supporting Jews fleeing persecution and poverty in Eastern Europe, our founders were guided by the traditions, texts and history of the Jewish people—a history of oppression, displacement and diaspora. HIAS has since helped generations of Jews facing violence because of who they were, and HIAS remains committed to helping Jewish refugees anywhere in the world. Today, our clients at HIAS come from diverse faiths, ethnicities and backgrounds, as do our staff. We bring our experience, history and values to our work across five continents, ensuring that refugees today receive the vital services and opportunities they need to thrive.




HIAS is a learning community, committed to diversity and inclusion. We do our work with integrity, accountability, transparency and a commitment to the highest ethical standards. We seek employees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences to join our teams located in the United States and across the globe. People who identify as BIPOC, people with disabilities, people from the LGBTQ+ community and people with lived experiences of forced displacement or immigration are all encouraged to apply. We are committed to building a diverse workforce that reflects our vision, mission and values.




VISION:

HIAS stands for a world in which refugees find welcome, safety and opportunity.




MISSION:

Drawing on our Jewish values and history, HIAS provides vital services to refugees and asylum seekers around the world and advocates for their fundamental rights so they can rebuild their lives.

Every FEMA employee has regular and recurring emergency management responsibilities, though not every position requires routine deployment to disaster sites.

Travel requirements in support of emergency operations may be extensive in nature (weeks to months), with little advance notice, and may require employees to relocate to emergency sites with physically austere and operationally challenging conditions.

We are currently looking for people to participate in our Menu Photo Collection project Finch.




What is the project about?

This project collects photos, live photos and short videos of menus (takeout menus, menus at restaurants, menus at boards, etc.). The photos collected will be used to support the development of technological products and services, including photo/video recognition services and artificial intelligence features.




This project can be a lot of fun! You can check your cabinets at home for takeaway menus, pick paper menus from your grocery store, go to a restaurant and check the dessert menu (even if you do not have a sweet tooth!), walk down the street and have a look at the chalkboard or the menu hanging at the door of an eatery. You can explore the almost unlimited variety of menus out there, dedicate a few minutes photographing them, and earn money you can spend on anything, even perhaps your next meal out!




Who is eligible?

To participate you should meet the following qualifying criteria:

 * Be 18 years or older.
 * Residing in the USA
 * Have an iPhone with iOS 17 or later with a functional camera.




Where is the project taking place?

This is a fully remote project. Note: all the photos should be taken within the USA.




How much is the compensation?

$0.80 USD per menu. For each menu you will need to take 2 photos. Due to the nature of the project, you will be able to participate many times with a variety of menus easy to obtain!




As payment method, we offer PayPal, Gift Card, Check and Wire Transfer according to your preference.




Please note that our Quality Assurance team will review all submissions to ensure they meet the project specific requirements. The project team will provide you with feedback once the Quality Check process is completed.

You can explore the almost unlimited variety of menus out there, dedicate a few minutes photographing them, and earn money you can spend on anything, even perhaps your next meal out!




Who is eligible?

To participate you should meet the following qualifying criteria:

 * Be 18 years or older.
 * Residing in the USA
 * Have an iPhone with iOS 17 or later with a functional camera.




Where is the project taking place?

This is a fully remote project. Note: all the photos should be taken within the USA.




How much is the compensation?

$0.80 USD per menu. For each menu you will need to take 2 photos. Due to the nature of the project, you will be able to participate many times with a variety of menus easy to obtain!




As payment method, we offer PayPal, Gift Card, Check and Wire Transfer according to your preference.




Please note that our Quality Assurance team will review all submissions to ensure they meet the project specific requirements. The project team will provide you with feedback once the Quality Check process is completed.

The analyst will work closely with the Director of Systems and Analytics, Senior Systems Implementation Analyst, and Software Database Architect to unshackle the agency from restrictive data siloes and grow responsive data ecosystems in their places. Together they will develop and leverage key stakeholder relationships to identify and build technical solutions to address systemic challenges related to leveraging analytics. The Analyst’s contributions will be vital in cultivating Office of Systems and Analytics (OSA)’s office culture that prioritizes kindness, excellence, transparency, and civic responsibility.

The role involves the application of advanced analytical and problem-solving skills to gather, analyze, interpret, and visualize data to inform legal strategies, policy formulation, and decision-making processes.

OGC faces significant challenges in using its many disparate and often antiquated case management systems to extract critical intel and develop key performance indicators for staffing, case triage, litigation approach, fraud-tracking and prevention, settlement opportunities, and policymaking. Developing these metrics is essential for OGC to shape a successful case management and resolution strategy in NYCPS’s ever-changing environment.

The Mission

The Office of Systems and Analytics’ unique mission is to reimagine the ineffective systems & protocols that disproportionately impact marginalized communities and impede the larger OGC in its mission to provide ethical legal counsel & representation and create safe & inclusive learning environments. Our goal is to empower OGC with modern analytics, business intelligence, and a robust data culture to create a vibrant community of well-trained, technically competent, inclusive, collaborative, and focused legal professionals.
