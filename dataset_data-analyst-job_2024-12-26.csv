When the application process is complete, we will review your resume to ensure you meet the hiring eligibility and qualification requirements listed in this announcement. You will be rated based on the information provided in your resume and responses to the Occupational Questionnaire, along with your supporting documentation to determine your ability to demonstrate the following competencies: * ANALYTICAL CONCEPTS, POLICIES, AND PRINCIPLES


 * ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES
 * COMPUTER LITERACY
 * PROBLEM SOLVING
 * REPORTING AND RECOMMENDATIONS
 * WRITTEN COMMUNICATION You should list any relevant performance appraisals and incentive awards in your resume as that information may be taken into consideration during the selection process. If selected, you may be required to provide supporting documentation. If after reviewing your resume and supporting documentation, a determination is made that you inflated your qualifications and/or experience, your score may be adjusted to more accurately reflect your abilities or you may be found ineligible/not qualified. Please follow all instructions carefully. Errors or omissions may affect your rating or consideration for employment. All eligibility, qualifications, and time-in-grade requirements must be met by the closing date of this announcement. Required Documents You are required to provide documentation that supports the eligibility and qualification claims made in your resume and assessment questionnaire. You must submit the applicable documents listed here and those listed with the eligibilities you select in the announcement questionnaire with your application package. Applicants who do not provide supporting documentation that fully support their claims will not be referred to the hiring manager. Cover letter is optional. A complete resume is required. Your resume must show relevant experience, job title, duties and accomplishments. Your resume must show complete information for each job entry to support minimum qualifications.

For GS positions, to be considered for promotion, you must provide SF-50(s) that shows you held the next lower GS grade for at least one year. SF-50s that have an effective date within the past year (e.g., General Adjustment SF-50 from this year or Within Rate/Grade Increases (WRI/WGI) SF-50 within a year) do not clearly show that you meet the one-year time-in-grade requirement. That means if you submit an SF-50 dated within the last year, you must submit another SF-50 that is dated more than one year ago to clearly demonstrate you meet the time-in-grade requirements. If you are a DoD employee, you can obtain a copy of your SF- 50(s) from My","Mid-Senior level","4108247091","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/management-analyst-with-security-clearance-at-clearancejobs-4108247091?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title","Millington, TN","12 hours ago","","","2024-12-26","","Defense and Space Manufacturing","MANAGEMENT ANALYST with Security Clearance","Business Development and Sales"

Developers can target product experiences to any customer segment and maximize the business impact of every feature. And by gradually rolling out new application components, they escape nightmare ""big-bang"" technology migrations.

The LaunchDarkly platform was built to guide engineers to the next frontier of DevOps by:


 * Improving the velocity and stability of software releases, without the fear of end customer outages
 * Delivering targeted experiences by easily personalizing features to customer cohorts
 * Maximizing the business impact of every feature through the ability to experiment and optimize
 * Coordinating the release and optimization of software to provide consistent experiences across mobile platforms and device types
 * Improving the effectiveness and productivity of engineering teams, by providing insights into engineering cadence and stability

We’re an early-stage startup on a mission to transform how Revenue Operations (RevOps) teams manage and unify their customer data. Our AI-powered platform (MVP in the works) integrates tools like Salesforce, Outlook, HubSpot, and more into one centralized workspace. We use graph databases, LLMs, and data pipelines to keep customer records clean, compliant, and always up to date—enabling a 360° view of every interaction. We’ve built the groundwork, and now we need someone to help us refine, scale, and get ready for our beta customers.




The Role




As our CTO/Tech Lead, you’ll lead the MVP build to a successful beta launch (in roughly 3 months) and beyond.




You won’t be starting from scratch—we already have a strong foundation in place. You’ll:

• Own the entire tech stack—front-end, back-end, AI integrations, AWS infrastructure.

• Enhance our existing architecture to handle more data, integrations, and AI-driven features.

• Drive the development process from planning sprints in Jira to merging pull requests on GitHub.

• Recruit and mentor engineers post-fundraise and help shape our dev culture.

• Champion a fun, collaborative environment, while navigating a fast-paced startup atmosphere.




Daily Dev Responsibilities

 * Full-Stack Development: Work on front-end (React/Redux) and back-end (NestJS) code, ensuring seamless data flow and top-notch user experiences.
 * AI Components: Integrate and refine AI workflows with frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI, or Azure Open AI.
 * Infrastructure & DevOps: Manage AWS serverless components (Lambda, SQS, API Gateway, etc.), deploy with Terraform, and maintain scalable, secure environments.
 * Data Pipelines & Integrations: Connect Salesforce, Outlook, and more, orchestrating data sync, cleaning, and compliance checks.
 * Team Oversight: Conduct code reviews, review and merge PRs,
 * Beta Launch Prep: Ensure everything’s in place—clean code, documented APIs, stable infra—so we can confidently onboard our first beta customers.




What We’re Looking For

 * AI Enthusiast: Someone genuinely excited about leveraging AI (LLMs, data pipelines, vector databases) to tackle real-world RevOps problems.
 * Commitment: A builder who’s ready to be part of our founding team and invests in our vision—long-term.
 * Hands-On Mindset: You can code backend (NestJS, Node), spin up AWS infrastructure, debug React flows, and optimize pipelines if needed.
 * Collaborative Leader: You set high standards, lead by example, and encourage open, positive communication.
 * Adaptability: You’re comfortable with shifting priorities and “figuring things out” in a high-growth environment.




What We’re Not Looking For

 * Agencies or Freelancers: This role demands focus and deep involvement in a single product, not juggling multiple external clients or projects.
 * Short-Term Engagement: If you’re just in it for a quick win, this won’t be the right fit. We need someone who sees the bigger picture and wants to build a future unicorn.




High-Level Tech Stack

 * Front-End: React 18, Material UI, Reactflow for diagramming, React-Redux & Redux Toolkit for state management.
 * Back-End: NestJS, Passport, TypeORM + PostgreSQL, Graph DB (AWS Neptune), Socket.io, AWS SDK, JWT-based auth.
 * AI/LLMs: LangChainJS, OpenAI (ChatGPT Turbo 3.5), Azure Open AI.
 * Infrastructure: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, Cognito, RDS PostgreSQL, Neptune, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, Amplify, VPC & Security Groups, KMS.
 * IaC: Terraform (>=1.3) to define and deploy infrastructure components.




(We’ve laid the groundwork. You’ll help optimize and scale it.)







Why Join Us

 * Immediate Impact: Help finalize our MVP for a beta launch in just three months.
 * Co-Founder Track: Equity ownership and direct influence on strategic decisions—this is more than just a job.
 * Culture of Trust & Fun: We value real connections, open communication, and the occasional meme-worthy Slack channel.
 * Growth Opportunities: After our first institutional raise, salary + perks get bumped to market standards—and you’ll lead a growing engineering team.




Ready to Build the Future of RevOps?

If you’re excited about bringing AI-driven innovations to customer data management, working with cutting-edge tech, and helping shape a “next unicorn” environment, let’s talk. We’re in this for the long haul—and we’d love to have you on board.
