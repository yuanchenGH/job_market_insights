The role

We’re looking for a skilled data analyst who can tackle complex, broad questions and provide actionable insights.

Your insights will help teams focus on the metrics that drive the most impact.
 * Generate insightful analysis for decision-making: When faced with broad business questions, you’ll dig into the data to uncover insights that empower leaders to make well-informed choices and identify next steps. Your analyses will clarify complex issues and drive alignment across GTM teams.
 * Build self-service tools that empower: Create user-friendly tools in Excel and BI platforms that allow teams to independently access key insights, streamlining data access and improving efficiency.




Connect the dots across the customer journey

 * Deliver actionable, big-picture insights: With an understanding of GTM metrics, you’ll connect data across functions to help teams see a comprehensive view of our customer journey, identifying what drives success across marketing, sales, customer success, and finance.
 * Communicate insights effectively: Present data in straightforward, accessible ways that resonate with both technical and non-technical audiences. Your findings will inspire alignment and guide actionable change.
 * Create scalable processes: Develop repeatable analysis methods for common metrics, reducing bottlenecks and enabling faster access to critical insights.




Proactively support performance and improvement

 * Spot gaps and opportunities early: Monitor key metrics to identify potential issues and areas of opportunity before they become pressing, allowing teams to act proactively and stay on track with objectives.
 * Recommend solutions that drive improvement: Go beyond identifying trends by offering suggestions and strategies that support continuous growth, performance improvement, and Kaizen across GTM, Finance, and Data teams.




What you’ll bring to the role:

 * 3-5 years of experience working closely with GTM teams (Marketing, Sales, Customer Success) as well as other important partners like Finance, Data, and Product in a fast-paced, startup environment, ideally within B2B SaaS.
 * Excellent Excel/Google Sheets skills, with advanced proficiency in creating models, managing large datasets, and leveraging pivot tables and formulas to support data analysis.

 * A stake in our success - generous equity with employee-friendly stock program
 * It’s not about how strong of a negotiator you are - our pay is based on transparent levels relative to experience

The Data Analyst work with the Director of Systems & Analytics, Sr. Data Analyst, Sr. Systems Implementation Analyst within the Office of the General Counsel’s (OGC) Office of Systems and Analytics (OSA) to build data collection, warehousing, reporting, and visualization tools to deliver actionable business intelligence to executive leadership.

The Analyst’s contributions will be vital in cultivating Office of Systems and Analytics (OSA)’s office culture that prioritizes kindness, excellence, transparency, and civic responsibility. The analyst’s leadership will be crucial in adopting next-generation technologies within NYCPS, including but not limited to Microsoft Azure, Power Platform, market-leading SaaS products, and machine learning and artificial intelligence. The Data Analyst is a high-impact role in the newly formed OSA.

The Challenge

Public reporting shows that the NYCPS’ Office of the General Counsel (OGC) is facing a ballooning number of annual special education cases. OGC faces significant challenges in using its many disparate and often antiquated case management systems to extract critical intel and develop key performance indicators for staffing, case triage, litigation approach, fraud-tracking and prevention, settlement opportunities, and policymaking. Developing these metrics is essential for OGC to shape a successful case management and resolution strategy in NYCPS’ ever-changing environment.

The Mission

The OSA’s unique mission is to reimagine the ineffective systems and protocols that disproportionately impact marginalized communities and impede the larger Office of the General Counsel (OGC) in its mission to provide ethical legal counsel and representation and create safe and inclusive learning environments. Our goal is to empower OGC with modern analytics, business intelligence, and a robust data culture to create a vibrant community of well-trained, technically competent, inclusive, collaborative, and focused legal professionals.

Wether you are optimizing analysis for marketing to tune their strategies, building new pipelines to drive down shipping speeds, or helping accounting drill down to track our business - your work will empower meaningful change for your customers.
