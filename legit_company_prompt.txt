Check this list of companies for me, list not legit companies. Companies hire people for part time or fulltime, or contract are good. List all companies that post fake positing to collect information, ask for unpaid work, charge people for training, or marketplace where people can only earn very little money by completing small tasks. Do due diligence on each one, don't just make things up.
