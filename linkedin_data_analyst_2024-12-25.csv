Hybrid work at Stripe

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $144,300 - $216,500. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

On the general management consulting side of this role, the individual will learn to prepare for, participate in, and facilitate two-day Program Strategy Workshops. These workshops typically include 20-30 senior academic and administrative leaders of a college or university. In the workshops, the Analyst will help clients use our system and answer questions about the data and technology. As the Analyst gains experience, they will have the opportunity to present material in the workshop and facilitate full-group discussions.




Our Analysts also conduct custom research on education markets for our clients. This research is well-structured, uses many of our tools and databases, and requires some primary research interviews and web research. In addition, Analysts perform ad-hoc research on specific topics as they arise. All of our Analysts have the opportunity to interact with clients on project conference calls and final reports. The Analyst will usually work directly with a Partner or the CEO to plan and review work, agree on critical findings, and prepare for and conduct client calls. 




On the big data side of the role, our Analysts learn to geocode records using our mapping software, pull data for relevant geographies, and set up client instances of our system. More importantly, Analysts build and update instances of Economics models for clients. This work will require processing large datasets, and can require knowledge of APIs, SQL, and other data transformation and processing tools. A background in finance would be beneficial.




The role provides excellent training in business, market research, analysis, and development of complex analytical software tools. There will be opportunities to learn from highly-experienced professionals, interact with clients, and do work that will influence the future of colleges and their students. 




The Analyst can work from anywhere in the U.S. that has a high-speed data connection. Work from abroad is also possible but must be performed largely during U.S. working hours.
