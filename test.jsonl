Check it out and apply via iHireFinance today!\n\nOur Purpose\n\nStanford Medicine is leading the biomedical revolution in precision health and medicine. We are transforming health care away from after-the-fact diagnosis to prediction and prevention and away from one-size-fits-all medicine to personalized care that empowers individuals to lead healthy lives. We are leveraging the art and science of medicine to predict and prevent disease before it strikes and cure it decisively if it does.\n\nTo achieve our Precision Health vision, we are integrating, building, and leveraging our strengths in fundamental research, the new field of biomedical data science, and nine transformative biomedical platforms. As a learning health system, we will apply these advances in our hospitals and health care delivery systems within Stanford Health Care and Stanford Childrens Health.\n\nOur Values\n\nFulfilling our promise to humanity requires the engagement of a diverse, creative, and collaborative team of professionals who work together to advance our research, education, and patient care mission. We strive to create a culture of inclusion and belonging to ensure all employees have the meaningful employment experience that is necessary to do their best work. We value and integrate justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion into all that we do to ensure equitable outcomes for our faculty, staff, and students.

The DFA partners with the chair, and other faculty and staff, to manage the financial and administrative areas of the department to include grant management, faculty and academic affairs, student affairs, external relations, and human resources. Additionally, the Director of Finance and Administration works with the Chair, and other faculty and staff, on areas of strategic planning and execution, grant portfolio development, educational programs and process excellence. The DFA partners with the Associate Dean\/Chief Financial Officer, peers, and cross-functional teams to enhance the SoMs operations in support of its research, teaching, and patient care mission.\n\nJob Summary\n\n\n * Lead finance and administration operations for a School of Medicine's unit or units (institute and academic department).

We serve as a resource to clients over the course of the partnership. This capital is provided through either private placements, senior secured loans, and mezzanine financings. A private placement issuance is a way for institutional investors to lend in a similar fashion as banks, with a \u201cbuy-and-hold\u201d approach, and with no required trading or public disclosures. Senior secured loans present options for businesses to acquire growth capital outside the traditional bank-lending process, while providing lenders top of the capital structure status. Mezzanine finance is subordinate to senior debt and does not usually require any amortization prior to maturity. Mezzanine is patient capital \u2013 meaning that it supports growth, while also being less costly than direct equity issuance.\n\nThe ideal candidate will be either a 2025 college graduate, or have 1-3 years of syndications, investment, and\/or credit underwriting experience, to join PGIM Private Capital Analyst Training in June 2025.\n\nTransaction Execution\n\nWhat you can expect\n\n\n * Learning the business through hands-on experience by being involved in every aspect of club transactions, from pre-screen to mandate, execution \/ Q&A, allocations, and closing.\n * Helping to manage, update and improve investor contact database, investor capability database, and the Clubbing & Placement SharePoint Site.\n * Manage the NDA process and other aspects of legal documentation.\n * Developing datasite management process (i.e. Intralinks \/ Zoom), so PPC can potentially manage this aspect of the process as needed.\n * Acting as primary contact for accounting and operations for fee reporting and notification.\n * Become an integral part of the regional underwriting teams on every clubbed transaction, in order to field, coordinate, and sort Q&A from investors.
