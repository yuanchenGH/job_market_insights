About Anomalo

Data management solutions accounted for more than one-fifth of all enterprise infrastructure spend in 2021. The “modern data stack” promises a centralized data platform for powering valuable new applications, from AI-powered products to real-time analytics.

Unfortunately, a big problem stands in the way of most data projects and products – the issue of data quality. Rules-based data quality approaches that worked when data was small and tightly controlled don’t scale. And with more data sources, transformations, and users, quality issues are multiplying fast. The vast majority of issues go uncaught—until they lead to an expensive fire drill.

Anomalo is the automated AI solution that plugs directly into the modern data stack and automatically monitors tables for a wide range of data quality issues. Our software uses unsupervised learning to catch deep problems in the data, like sudden changes in the distribution, that aren’t covered by static rules or basic observability. With built-in root cause analysis, Anomalo shows not only whether data is anomalous but also why and what the impact is. This prevents data issues from reaching dashboards, reports, and products, while data teams spend less time debugging and more time building.

We’re rapidly growing and work with some of the biggest brands leveraging data today, like Block, Discover Financial Services, Buzzfeed, and Notion. The company has raised a total of $82M seed through Series B extension funding and is backed by top-tier venture firms like SignalFire, Norwest Venture Partners, Databricks Ventures, Foundation Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, and First Round Capital.

Anomalo is building the platform that data-driven companies need to be able to make good data-driven decisions and would love to have you join for the ride.

We are committed to providing reasonable accommodations to ensure equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities throughout the hiring process and in the workplace. This includes support for participating in interviews and performing essential job duties. Please contact us at interviewsupport@anomalo.com.

Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and Twitter, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.

About The Team

The Community Discovery Machine Learning (CDML) team powers the systems that help millions of active viewers find the creators and communities they'll enjoy most. Powering the home page recommendations, browse, search, and feed ranking experiences, this team and its algorithms are at the heart of enabling the connections that make Twitch a great place for so many users.

About The Role

Data is critical to the algorithms that power the recommendation, search, and ranking systems. It's also critical to making decisions, especially working on systems that are themselves data-driven. As a Senior Data Scientist on the CDML team, you'll be responsible for helping drive improvements to the machine learning systems as well as analytics to drive decision-making.

While there is a team of Applied Scientists building and shipping the algorithms themselves, data science can help improve these systems directly. In this role, you can identify and build new signals to input into the models. We're also working on the value model that the algorithm optimizes, and your input will be critical to understanding the tradeoffs and balancing multiple objectives in a scientific way.

We also still have big unanswered analytics questions to solve. How often do viewers just want to get to the content they already know they want to watch, and when are they open to exploring new channels? These are the sorts of questions you'll be tackling.

You can work in San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; or Seattle, WA.

You Will:



 * Inform product strategies by defining and updating core metrics for each initiative
 * Estimate the opportunity sizing of new features the team could take on
 * Identify and build new signals to incorporate into the algorithms driving recommendations, search, and feed ranking at Twitch
 * Identify metric tradeoff ratios that help inform value model choices, long-term impact from early-growth-funnel users, and other product decisions
 * Establish analytical framework for your team: ad-hoc analysis, automated dashboards, and self-service reporting tools to surface key data to stakeholders
 * Design A/B experiments to drive product direction with iterative innovation and measurement
 * Work hand-in-hand with business, product, engineering, and design to proactively influence and inform teammates' decisions throughout the product life cycle
 * Distill ambiguous product or business questions, find clever ways to answer them, and to quantify the uncertainty
   
   
   

You Have:



 * BA/BS in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or equivalent industry experience
 * 5+ years of experience as a data scientist or data analyst in a high velocity, data-driven environment
 * 5+ years of machine learning/statistical modeling data analysis tools and techniques, and parameters that affect their performance experience
 * Expert SQL skills and proficiency in Python/R
 * Experience using data to create insight, drive business decisions and influence leadership
   
   
   

Bonus Points



 * MS/MA or higher in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical field
 * Experience working on algorithms powering large-scale consumer services
 * Experience in a data science team working on customer software products, analytics, and insights
 * Experience working with software development and operational event data
 * Familiarity with Twitch, either as a viewer or creator (or both!)

About CloudZero:

Cloud cost management is one of the biggest challenges organizations face today. As cloud adoption continues to accelerate, so do the complexities and costs associated with it — and macroeconomic conditions only increase pressure to prove cloud efficiency. That's why we built CloudZero: a SaaS platform at the intersection of next-generation cloud cost management and FinOps. CloudZero ingests billing and usage data from all cloud, SaaS, and PaaS providers, organizes it in real time according to our customers' business structures, lets customers view it at any level of time or resource granularity, and ultimately empowers them to make more informed business decisions.

Since our founding in 2016, our mission has been to make efficient innovation a reality for every cloud-driven organization. At CloudZero, we believe every engineering decision is a buying decision, yet the cost conversation often bypasses the engineers who drive those determinations. To solve this, we've built a dynamic, single-page application that answers the complex, data-heavy questions every cloud-based organization needs to ask if they want to grow their company profitably.

To date, we've raised over $52 million from leading venture capital firms across the country. We're solving problems of massive scale, business importance, and complexity in a space that needs it more than ever. We're growing rapidly and would love for you to be a part of it!

Equal Opportunity Employer

CloudZero is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status or disability status. All job offers are contingent upon the candidate passing background and reference checks.","Director","4099109159","https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/principal-data-scientist-engineer-office-of-cto-at-cloudzero-4099109159?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title","Boston, MA","3 days ago","","","2024-12-13","","Non-profit Organizations and Primary and Secondary Education","Principal Data Scientist/Engineer - Office of CTO","Engineering"

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same. .

You Will


 * Deeply understand the Sales and Account Management data ecosystem, and apply data science techniques to support the growth of the organization
 * Be the subject matter expert for our revenue forecasting models and how they are applied to the Sales organization.

 * Partner with Machine Learning engineers to support measurement and evaluation of ML models
 * Apply descriptive and predictive analytics to help drive insights and business decisions
 * Communicate analyses and decisions to high-level stakeholders and executives in verbal, visual, and written formats
 * Apply a diverse set of tactics such as causal inference, quantitative reasoning, and machine learning to research and produce insights

Sunshine Act

Pfizer reports payments and other transfers of value to health care providers as required by federal and state transparency laws and implementing regulations. These laws and regulations require Pfizer to provide government agencies with information such as a health care provider’s name, address and the type of payments or other value received, generally for public disclosure. Subject to further legal review and statutory or regulatory clarification, which Pfizer intends to pursue, reimbursement of recruiting expenses for licensed physicians may constitute a reportable transfer of value under the federal transparency law commonly known as the Sunshine Act. Therefore, if you are a licensed physician who incurs recruiting expenses as a result of interviewing with Pfizer that we pay or reimburse, your name, address and the amount of payments made currently will be reported to the government. If you have questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact your Talent Acquisition representative.

Citizen is the No. 1 public safety app in the U.S., with a mission to make the world a safer place. Citizen provides 911 alerts so people can use their phones to keep themselves, and the people and places they love, safe. Citizen has notified people to evacuate burning buildings, deterred school buses from nearby terrorist attacks, and led to the rescue of kidnapped children and missing people.




Citizen’s 911 alerts are accompanied by live stories, real-time updates, and user-generated content so app users never have to wonder why there are helicopters overhead or fire engines flying by. By broadcasting from the scene of an incident, communicating with one another, and reading live updates, communities are empowered by Citizen. We act fast, break news, and give people the immediate information they need to stay safe. And we’re just getting started.




Our flagship paid product—Citizen Premium—is a only-of-its-kind personal safety subscription that allows users to reach a digital guardian 24/7 for $20/mo. Subscribers used Citizen Premium to guide emergency response to remote hiking locations, or travel safely on late-night walks.

Citizen Plus, which sits between the free Citizen app and Citizen Premium at $5/mo, currently unlocks 6 new features. Available for the first time ever, Citizen Plus includes the powerful ability to listen to police and fire radios, customize your alerts, unlock past incidents, create alert zones, view nearby registered offenders, and see crime statistics.




Already relied on by millions of people every day, Citizen will expand even further across the United States this year to keep more users safe and informed. We’re looking for hardworking, mission-driven individuals to help bring Citizen to hundreds of cities nationwide.

Citizen is backed by 8VC, Founders Fund, Goodwater Capital, and Greycroft and has raised $100M+ in VC funding.

Twitch is the world’s biggest live streaming service, with global communities built around gaming, entertainment, music, sports, cooking, and more. It is where thousands of communities come together for whatever, every day.

We’re about community, inside and out. You’ll find coworkers who are eager to team up, collaborate, and smash (or elegantly solve) problems together. We’re on a quest to empower live communities, so if this sounds good to you, see what we’re up to on LinkedIn and Twitter, and discover the projects we’re solving on our Blog. Be sure to explore our Interviewing Guide to learn how to ace our interview process.

About The Team

The Community Discovery Machine Learning (CDML) team powers the systems that help millions of active viewers find the creators and communities they'll enjoy most. Powering the home page recommendations, browse, search, and feed ranking experiences, this team and its algorithms are at the heart of enabling the connections that make Twitch a great place for so many users.

About The Role

Data is critical to the algorithms that power the recommendation, search, and ranking systems. It's also critical to making decisions, especially working on systems that are themselves data-driven. As a Senior Data Scientist on the CDML team, you'll be responsible for helping drive improvements to the machine learning systems as well as analytics to drive decision-making.

While there is a team of Applied Scientists building and shipping the algorithms themselves, data science can help improve these systems directly. In this role, you can identify and build new signals to input into the models. We're also working on the value model that the algorithm optimizes, and your input will be critical to understanding the tradeoffs and balancing multiple objectives in a scientific way.

We also still have big unanswered analytics questions to solve. How often do viewers just want to get to the content they already know they want to watch, and when are they open to exploring new channels? These are the sorts of questions you'll be tackling.

You can work in San Francisco, CA; New York, NY; or Seattle, WA.

You Will:



 * Inform product strategies by defining and updating core metrics for each initiative
 * Estimate the opportunity sizing of new features the team could take on
 * Identify and build new signals to incorporate into the algorithms driving recommendations, search, and feed ranking at Twitch
 * Identify metric tradeoff ratios that help inform value model choices, long-term impact from early-growth-funnel users, and other product decisions
 * Establish analytical framework for your team: ad-hoc analysis, automated dashboards, and self-service reporting tools to surface key data to stakeholders
 * Design A/B experiments to drive product direction with iterative innovation and measurement
 * Work hand-in-hand with business, product, engineering, and design to proactively influence and inform teammates' decisions throughout the product life cycle
 * Distill ambiguous product or business questions, find clever ways to answer them, and to quantify the uncertainty
   
   
   

You Have:



 * BA/BS in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or equivalent industry experience
 * 5+ years of experience as a data scientist or data analyst in a high velocity, data-driven environment
 * 5+ years of machine learning/statistical modeling data analysis tools and techniques, and parameters that affect their performance experience
 * Expert SQL skills and proficiency in Python/R
 * Experience using data to create insight, drive business decisions and influence leadership
   
   
   

Bonus Points



 * MS/MA or higher in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related technical field
 * Experience working on algorithms powering large-scale consumer services
 * Experience in a data science team working on customer software products, analytics, and insights
 * Experience working with software development and operational event data
 * Familiarity with Twitch, either as a viewer or creator (or both!)
   
   
   

Perks



 * Medical, Dental, Vision & Disability Insurance
 * 401(k)
 * Maternity & Parental Leave
 * Flexible PTO
 * Amazon Employee Discount
   
   
   

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at Twitch. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bots, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms.

Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to protecting companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by digital attacks. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).

Even if you’re not a conventional “hacker” we can assure you that you are a hacker in your own right. We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN. You’ll be joining us at an exciting moment in the HUMAN story: we joined forces with PerimeterX in a market-changing merger , as well as recently acquired clean.io to enhance the Human Defense Platform. Together under the HUMAN brand, we will disrupt the economics of cybercrime. We hope you can join us in that mission.

The Enterprise Research team at HUMAN is dedicated to protecting the internet by disrupting the economics of cybercrime. Our team of Data Scientists research and develop algorithms to detect bots and fight fraud. We use statistical and machine learning techniques, in both offline and real-time infrastructures, to provide our customers with proactive security and insights into their attacks.

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our team to support the full-cycle of fraud fighting: from the early stages of gathering business requirements and exploratory research to the development and deployment in production of statistical detection techniques. This role is at the intersection of data, technology, and business as we aspire to deeply understand how actors are perpetrating schemes and develop a powerful product to delight our customers.

What you'll do:


 * Partner with Product, Engineering, and Analysts to support our business goals in improving bot detection, building out competitive product features, and optimizing our data and ML infrastructure
 * Research and experiment with the latest detection frameworks in cyber security and fraud, statistical techniques, and ML tooling
 * Support the growth of best practices and Data Science standards in detection and modeling
 * Be an active participant in team responsibilities, including reviewing other data scientists’ work prior to launching new detection rules/algorithms, our ‘sheriffing’ process where we proactively monitor anomalies arising in our systems and taking part in ‘tech-debt days’ to keep our codebase clean and healthy.
 * Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, that ‘creating tau’ (disproportionate leverage) by accelerating our team’s ability to find fraud, automating cumbersome tasks, and creating novel methodologies. by empowering the other humans around you.
   
   
   

Who you are:


 * You have experience solving large-scale, data-intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!).
 * You can explain the nuances of different statistical modeling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers.
 * You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms. You are fluent in Object Oriented development and have strong debugging skills.
 * You have a good sense of ownership which drives you to find ways to do things better, faster, and leaner; you hold yourself accountable for the quality and accuracy of your work
 * You have experience working on cross-functional projects, with multiple stakeholders - both technical and non-technical; and following SDLC best practices: project management, version control, unit testing, and CI/CD
   
   
   

The base pay range for this position is $90,000- $150,000 which can include additional on-target commission pay/bonus. The base pay offered may vary depending on location, job related knowledge, skills, and experience. Stock options and other incentive pay may be provided as part of the compensation package, in addition to a full range of medical, financial, and/or other benefits, depending on the position ultimately offered.

HUMAN prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!

With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, we have teams in Tel Aviv, Israel; London, UK; Victoria, Canada; San Mateo, CA; Miami, FL; and Virginia.

We trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The total rewards package we provide reflects our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for wellbeing and learning & development, and a one time home office setup stipend. We also offer weekly lunches, dedicated time off, no-meeting Fridays (for our U.S. and Intl. based HUMANs), HUMAN days, and so much more.

We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life. Taking care of one another is part of the HUMAN experience and how we build true HUMAN connections.

Logistics

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How we're different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

About The Job

Google is one of the pioneers of modern digital advertising, and the enabler of a thriving and open internet advertising ecosystem that supports users, publishers, and advertisers. Modern digital advertising is a scaled business that relies on a mutually-reinforcing cycle of ad-sales, ad-planning, ad-implementation/optimization and ad-measurement. Ad-measurement is key to this cycle, and consequently is critical to the business. Among other things, good measurement helps advertisers and platforms to conceptualize, create and plan successful campaigns; to serve the right ads to the right users; to help allocate resources to the right channels and to allocate bids in auctions and budgets across campaigns appropriately; and to audit the efficacy of ads in delivering on various campaign goals. Good measurement is also key for ensuring users are exposed to ads they find useful; and for ensuring publishers, content creators, and other ad-tech firms can monetize their content appropriately; both of which are key to sustaining an open and vibrant internet.

Google’s advertising measurement team focuses on combining data at scale with formal science to make this possible. Our science helps make advertising useful and delightful to our users, and valuable and results-driven for our advertisers and publishers.

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $150,000-$223,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. The range displayed on each job posting reflects the minimum and maximum target salaries for the position across all US locations. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your preferred location during the hiring process.

Please note that the compensation details listed in US role postings reflect the base salary only, and do not include bonus, equity, or benefits. Learn more about benefits at Google .

Responsibilities


 * Collaborate with stakeholders in cross-projects and team settings to identify and clarify business or product questions to answer. Provide feedback to translate and refine business questions into tractable analysis, evaluation metrics, or mathematical models.
 * Use custom data infrastructure or existing data models as appropriate. Design and evaluate models to mathematically express and solve defined problems with limited precedent.
 * Gather, extract, and compile data across sources via relevant tools (e.g., SQL, R, Python). Format, re-structure, and/or validate data to ensure quality, and review the dataset to ensure it is ready for analysis.
 * Shape new data-driven and privacy-preserving advertising and marketing products in collaboration with engineering, product, and customer-facing teams.
 * Use causal inference methods to design and suggest experiments and new ways to establish causality, assess attribution, and answer strategic questions using data.

Work Type: Hybrid

Job Location: Oakland

Department Overview

The Enterprise Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (EDS&AI) department is both a “Delivery” team that is a sophisticated practitioner of data science and a “Center of Excellence” team that supports other practitioners in an enterprise-wide Hub & Spoke analytics adoption model.

As a Delivery team, this Department uses industry leading data science, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and Generative AI (GenAI) technologies to drive PG&E’s transition to the sustainable grid of the future. EDS&AI works cross-functionally across the company to enable data driven decisions applying advanced analytics & AI techniques, as well as improvements to relevant business processes. Deployed to some of PG&E’s highest priority arenas, EDS&AI does not specialize in a traditional utility domain, such as asset management or program administration, but instead specializes in extracting useful insights from disparate data sets and facilitating actions informed by these insights.

As a Center of Excellence in DS&AI team, this Department listens to the needs of AI/ML/GenAI and data science practitioners across the company, along with emerging industry practices, and builds standards, processes, tools, knowledge, and best practices that meet the current and future needs of the enterprise.

This team works on a wide variety of difficult problems, offering great variety in the work, and constant opportunity to explore and learn. Current and past engagements include:


 * Creating wildfire risk models that are used by regulators and the utility to prioritize asset management
 * Developing computer vision models that improve, accelerate, and automate asset inspections processes
 * Predicting electric distribution equipment failure before it occurs, allowing for proactive maintenance
 * Forming the analytical framework behind PG&E’s Transmission Public Safety Power Shutoff
 * Optimizing non-wires alternative resource portfolios, like the Oakland Clean Energy Initiative, including location and resource adequacy considerations
 * Analyzing customer demographic, program participation, and SmartMeter interval data to build program targeted propensity models, e.g., for customer owned distributed energy resource technologies
 * Identifying and investigating anomalous customer natural gas usage, in order to resolve dangerous customer side leaks
   
   

Position Summary

We are seeking two (2) experienced data scientist to join PG&E as expert members of company’s Center of Excellence in Data Science & AI. Each technical leadership role has an unparalleled opportunity to influence the success of data science and related AI technical fields (ML and GenAI) across a large, diverse company with an essential societal mission. Each role is perfectly suited for a candidate with deep experience leading technical portfolios focusing on AI/ML/GenAI modeling work, and who would now like to make a contribution to the data science community by supporting teams across the company rather than delivering solutions directly. A desire and aptitude for consulting, mentoring, advising, educating, influencing, and relationship building is strongly needed. This technical leader will be an individual contributor who possesses a drive to keep their skills sharp through continuous education and research as they assist with a wide variety of advance data science and analytics projects across the company. Study and continuous assessment of emerging technologies will facilitate thought leadership and influence technical roadmaps.

Strictly data science-AI/ML/GenAI algorithm-related software engineering skills are desired with experience developing production-ready code and managing data science products through the delivery cycle. Emphasis will be placed on a knowledge of and experience with algorithms, theory, measurement and evaluation, coding, tooling, data systems, and support environments specific to data science and AI. Successful candidates may come from diverse backgrounds including data science, ML engineering, software engineering, physical sciences, and others (education requirements listed below). This role will also make contributions to the development and implementation of standards, processes, governance frameworks, guidelines, and operational product excellence (i.e., AI/ML/GenAI product lifecycle evaluation, along with scalability, validity, and other performance measures). Finally, another critical component of this profile is AI/ML/GenAI model evaluation and performance assessment when vendors or third-party developers formulate proposals or develop solutions for internal Functional teams.

The role is hybrid working from your remote office and in-person based on business needs or company requirements.

Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bots, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms.

Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to protecting companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by digital attacks. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).

Even if you’re not a conventional “hacker” we can assure you that you are a hacker in your own right. We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN. You’ll be joining us at an exciting moment in the HUMAN story: we joined forces with PerimeterX in a market-changing merger , as well as recently acquired clean.io to enhance the Human Defense Platform. Together under the HUMAN brand, we will disrupt the economics of cybercrime. We hope you can join us in that mission.

The Enterprise Research team at HUMAN is dedicated to protecting the internet by disrupting the economics of cybercrime. Our team of Data Scientists research and develop algorithms to detect bots and fight fraud. We use statistical and machine learning techniques, in both offline and real-time infrastructures, to provide our customers with proactive security and insights into their attacks.

We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our team to support the full-cycle of fraud fighting: from the early stages of gathering business requirements and exploratory research to the development and deployment in production of statistical detection techniques. This role is at the intersection of data, technology, and business as we aspire to deeply understand how actors are perpetrating schemes and develop a powerful product to delight our customers.

What you'll do:


 * Partner with Product, Engineering, and Analysts to support our business goals in improving bot detection, building out competitive product features, and optimizing our data and ML infrastructure.
 * Research and experiment with the latest detection frameworks in cyber security and fraud, statistical techniques, and ML tooling.
 * Support the growth of best practices and Data Science standards in detection and modeling.
 * Lead large scale projects and drive change that impacts not just yourself, but the Data Scientists and analysts around you and across our Business Units.
 * Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, that ‘creating tau’ (disproportionate leverage) by accelerating our team’s ability to find fraud, automating cumbersome tasks, and creating novel methodologies. by empowering the other humans around you.
   
   
   

Who you are:


 * You have experience solving large-scale, data-intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!).
 * You can explain the nuances of different statistical modeling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers.
 * You have the ability to think 3 steps ahead in designing a data driven product, bring clarity to problems with ambiguity, and bring simplicity to problems with complexity.
 * You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms. You are fluent in Object Oriented development and have strong debugging skills.
 * You have a good sense of ownership which drives you to find ways to do things better, faster, and leaner; you hold yourself accountable for the quality and accuracy of your work.
 * You have experience working on cross-functional projects, with multiple stakeholders - both technical and non-technical; and following SDLC best practices: project management, version control, unit testing, and CI/CD.
   
   
   

The base pay range for this position is $165,000- $205,000 which can include additional on-target bonus and/or incentives. The base pay offered may vary depending on location, job related knowledge, skills, and experience. Stock options and other incentive pay may be provided as part of the compensation package, in addition to a full range of medical, financial, and/or other benefits, depending on the position ultimately offered.

HUMAN prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!

With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, we have teams in Tel Aviv, Israel; London, UK; Victoria, Canada; San Mateo, CA; Miami, FL; and Virginia.

We trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The total rewards package we provide reflects our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for wellbeing and learning & development, and a one time home office setup stipend. We also offer weekly lunches, dedicated time off, no-meeting Fridays (for our U.S. and Intl. based HUMANs), HUMAN days, and so much more.

We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life. Taking care of one another is part of the HUMAN experience and how we build true HUMAN connections.

What We’re Like


 * Scrappy. We had a product goal and put out the MVP, collecting our first users with steady growth via paid channels in four months. We don’t cut corners when we know we’ll need them but we don’t build things without that need. We don’t like inefficiency but we dislike operationalizing one-off tasks even more.
 * Risk-oriented. Everything has risk, but a mature team knows how to make these tradeoffs. That’s why we built the MVP fast––because time is your most valuable asset and is practically fungible with money in the startup world.
 * Data-obsessed. We all look at data and pull it, and we believe that understanding the mechanics can yield valuable insights. Complex systems require elegant, not just simple solutions. You absolutely need to be interested in data if you want to leverage your knowledge of systems.
 * Lucky. That’s how we look at this journey so far. From our timing of fundraising, to the circumstances in which we came together, to the initial product traction we’re getting, there’s no other word to describe it. We are grateful you are reading this, and we know that if you’re meant to be with us on this journey, then we will see you soon.
